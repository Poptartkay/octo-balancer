### The challenge
​
User Story - 
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


Acceptance Criteria -
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

### What I learned

Doing this challenge gave me a broader idea on how to integrate time and date with JS.
Doing so allows the user to have the approximate time and date for their schedule of the
day.

​

​
### Continued development
This is still in on going development as I need to add in local storage and currate a past
present and future for the hours.
